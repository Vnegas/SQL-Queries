# SQL, NoSQL & SpatialSQL Practice Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of queries and exercises from my **Advanced SQL course** and **personal practice**.  
It covers **SQL**, **Analytics SQL**, **NoSQL**, and **SpatialSQL (Oracle APEX)**, serving as both a learning log and a reference hub for advanced database concepts.
